# About Bladecrawl:  
BladeCrawl is a 2D platformer and dungeon crawler in which you explore a generated dungeon system and try to progress as far as you can possibly manage by fighting monsters and collecting valuable gems in those caves with your sword and powerful abilities.

The Game was made as a 10 week Semester project during my first Semester
at the S4G School for Games. It was my first experience making a game in a semi professional environment.
